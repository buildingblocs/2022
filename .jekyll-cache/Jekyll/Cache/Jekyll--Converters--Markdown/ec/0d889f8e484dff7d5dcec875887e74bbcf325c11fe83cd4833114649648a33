<blockquote>
  <p>‘A’ level / Integrated Programme and ‘O’ level Computing students come together to build an infocomm-empowered future for a Better World!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BuildingBloCS is a year-long outreach programme for students, by students! Activities and workshops will be conducted by JC Computing students, guided by their teachers, to educate people around the nation about the wonders of Computing, and spread its love. Activities need not be entirely technical, and they can be something like creatively integrating Computing concepts into usual activities!</p>

<h3 id="we-have-a-discord-server">We have a Discord server!</h3>

<p>We will be posting regular updates through the server and it will be the easiest and quickest way to get the most up-to-date information regarding upcoming BuildingBloCS events and workshops.</p>
